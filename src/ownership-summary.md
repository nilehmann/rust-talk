# Summary

<div style="font-size: 35px">

* All heap data must be owned by exactly one variable.
* Rust deallocates heap data once its owner goes out of scope.
* Ownership can be transferred by moves, which happen on assignments and function calls.
* Heap data can only be accessed through its current owner, not a previous owner.
